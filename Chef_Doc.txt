==>What is a resource?
A resource represents a piece of infrastructure and its desired state, such as a package that should be installed, a service that should be running, or a file that should be generated.
Resources describe the what, not the how
A recipe is a file that holds one or more resources. Each resource declares what state a part of the system should be in, but not how to get there. Chef handles these complexities for you
Resources have actions

==>What is a recipe?
A recipe is a collection of resources that describes a particular configuration or policy. A recipe describes everything that is required to configure part of a system. Recipes do things such as:

install and configure software components.
manage files.
deploy applications.
execute other recipes.
Recipes organize resources


==> Configure a package and service
Like files, packages and services are also types of resources. Chef applies resources in the order you specify

-->Cookbook

A cookbook provides structure to your recipes and enables you to more easily reference external files, such as our web server's home page. In essence, a cookbook helps you stay organized.
With a cookbook you're now better organized. A cookbook adds structure to your work. You can now author your HTML code in its own file and use a template resource to reference it from your recipe

==>Run-LISt

A run-list specifies each of the individual recipes from your cookbook that you want to apply
The run-list lets you specify which recipes to run, and the order in which to run them
